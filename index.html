	<!-- Paragraph one - contains educational information -->
    <p>Hello, my name is <strong>Caleb Rooke.</strong> 
	I am <em>currently</em> a freshman at NC State University, with an intended major in Computer Engineering.
	I chose this major because of my love for systems.
	I think it is really beautiful how pieces of hardware that are useless on their own can come together to achieve great things.</p>    
	<br />
	
	<!-- Paragraph two - contains information about my dream job -->
	<p style="font-family: Arial; font-size:12; color:#00EEFF">
	I aspire to one day become a <ins>Computer Architect for NVidia.</ins>
	I think it would be a lot of fun to produce the worlds' highest end computer specifications on a team of brilliant people.
	I don't know if I can achieve this goal, but I will make sure to try my absolute best!</p>
